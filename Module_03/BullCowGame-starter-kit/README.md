# :water_buffalo: Bull :cow2: Cow Game
## Description  
Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls) is an old -breaking mind or paper and pencil game for two or more players, predating the commercially marketed board game Mastermind.  
It is a game that may date back a century or more which uses numbers or words. It is played by two opponents.  
### The word version
This version is usually played orally, but is easier to play if each player (or each team) keeps written notes. It is exactly like the numerical version except instead of 4-digit numbers, 4-letter words are used. They must be real words, according to whatever language or languages you are playing the game in. Alternate versions of the game can be played with 3-letter or 5-letter words, but the 4-letter version is the most popular.  
The game play for letter version of this game is as follows.  
A person (Host) thinks of any isogram word, and gives out the number of letters in the word.  
Other players (Guessers) try to figure that word by guessing isogram words containing the same number of letters.  
Host responds with the number of Cows & Bulls for each guessed word. As with the digit version, "Cow" means a letter in the wrong position, while "Bull" means a letter in the right position.  
For example, if the secret word is HEAT, a guess of COIN would result in "0 Bulls, 0 Cows" (all of the guessed letters are wrong); a guess of EATS would result in "0 Bulls, 3 Cows" (since E, A, T are all present, but not in the guessed positions), and a guess of TEAL would result in "2 Bulls, 1 Cow" (since E and A are in the right positions, while T is in the wrong position). The game would continue until someone scores "4 Bulls" for guessing HEAT exactly.
